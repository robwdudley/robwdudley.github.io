Welcome to my first blog post! I suppose I should start with the reason for this site.

I started this project to work on my writing, showcase various projects I've done, and as
an exercise of the [Feynman technique of learning](https://fs.blog/2021/02/feynman-learning-technique/) (i.e., writing about things you wish to understand more).

I'm also hoping this site will help me stand out among my peers once I graduate in December 2021.
