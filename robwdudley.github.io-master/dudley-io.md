      <p>To be perfectly clear, <em>I DID NOT DESIGN THIS WEBSITE</em>. I was looking for inspiration to create a simple website that still had a little personality. I stumbled across a project on dribbble from the designer, <a href="https://dribbble.com/tonikstudio" target="_blank">Tonik</a>, and decided to just code the project while still giving them credit for the design. I've included a credit to Tonik in the footer while also linking to their page on dribbble. They do great work!</p>
